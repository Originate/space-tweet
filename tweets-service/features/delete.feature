Feature: Deleting an entry

  Rules:
  - when receiving "tweets.delete", removes the entry with the given id and returns "tweets.deleted"


  Background:
    Given an instance of this service
    And the service contains the entries:
      | CONTENT   | OWNER_ID |
      | Monday    | 1        |
      | Tuesday   | 1        |
      | Wednesday | 1        |


  Scenario: deleting an existing entry
    When sending the message "tweets.delete" with the payload:
      """
      {
        "id": "{{.IdOf( "Tuesday")}}"
      }
      """
    Then the service replies with "tweets.deleted" and the payload:
      """
      {
        "id": "{{.IdOf(\"Tuesday\")}}",
        "content": "Tuesday",
        "owner_id": "1"
      }
      """
    And the service now contains the entries:
      | CONTENT   | OWNER_ID |
      | Monday    | 1        |
      | Wednesday | 1        |


  Scenario: trying to delete a non-existing entry
    When sending the message "tweets.delete" with the payload:
      """
      {
        "id": "zonk"
      }
      """
    Then the service replies with "tweets.not-found" and the payload:
      """
      {
        "id": "zonk"
      }
      """
    And the service now contains the entries:
      | CONTENT   | OWNER_ID |
      | Monday    | 1        |
      | Tuesday   | 1        |
      | Wednesday | 1        |
