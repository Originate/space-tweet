Feature: Creating entries

  Rules:
  - entries must have a content
  - when successful, the service replies with "tweets.created"
    and the newly created entry
  - when there is an error, the service replies with "tweets.not-created"
    and a message describing the error


  Background:
    Given an instance of this service


  Scenario: creating a valid entry
    When sending the message "tweets.create" with the payload:
      """
      {
        "owner_id": "1",
        "content": "Hello world"
      }
      """
    Then the service replies with "tweets.created" and the payload:
      """
      {
        "id": "{{idOf "Hello world"}}",
        "owner_id": "1",
        "content": "Hello world"
      }
      """
    And the service now contains the entries:
      | CONTENT     | OWNER_ID |
      | Hello world | 1        |


  Scenario: trying to create an entry with empty content
    When sending the message "tweets.create" with the payload:
      """
      {
        "owner_id": "1",
        "content": ""
      }
      """
    Then the service replies with "tweets.not-created" and the payload:
      """
      {
        "error": "Content cannot be blank"
      }
      """
    And the service contains no entries
